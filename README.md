## Compute properties of Haken manifolds from the Hodson Weeks census

In this project, we compute and record various properties of Haken QH$S^3$ from the Hodson--Weeks census. [The file](https://github.com/Khanh-LeCoder/HodsonWeeksHakenProperties/blob/main/HakenList.txt) contains the list of Haken 3-manifold from the Hodgson Weeks census. The software Regina was used to certify Hakeness of these manifolds. We note that a few Haken manifold maybe missing from the list. Using SnapPy, we pick out Haken QH$S^3$ from the the list, compute and record various properties in [the file](https://github.com/Khanh-LeCoder/HodsonWeeksHakenProperties/blob/main/Haken_QHS3_Data.md). 

For each Haken QH$S^3$ $M$ from the list, we compute

1. The volume of $M$
2. The homology of $M$
3. Whether or not $\pi_1(M)$ admits an infinite dihedral quotient
4. The dimension of the $SL_2(C)$-character variety of $\pi_1(M)$
5. If the dimension of the $SL_2(C)$-character variety of $\pi_1(M)$ is zero, then whether or not there exists algebraic non-integral characters.
